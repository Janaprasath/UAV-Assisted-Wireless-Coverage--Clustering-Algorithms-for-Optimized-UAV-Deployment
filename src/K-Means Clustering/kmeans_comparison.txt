K-Means Clustering Algorithm:
* K-Means partitions data into K clusters by iteratively minimizing the distance between points and cluster centroids. 
* It works in 4 steps:
1. Initialize K random centroids
2. Assign points to the nearest centroid
3. Recalculate centroids as cluster means
4. Repeat until convergence
