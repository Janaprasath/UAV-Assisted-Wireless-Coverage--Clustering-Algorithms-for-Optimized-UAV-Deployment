K-Means Clustering Algorithm:

1. K-Means partitions data into K clusters by iteratively minimizing the distance between points and cluster centroids. It works in 4 steps:
2. Initialize K random centroids
3. Assign points to the nearest centroid
4. Recalculate centroids as cluster means
5. Repeat until convergence
