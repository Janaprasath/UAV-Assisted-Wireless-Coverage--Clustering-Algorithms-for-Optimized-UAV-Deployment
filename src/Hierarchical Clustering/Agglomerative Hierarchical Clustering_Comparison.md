AGGLOMERATIVE HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING ALGORITHM:
- Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) builds a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging the closest pairs of clusters until a stopping criterion (e.g., number of clusters) is met. It uses linkage criteria (e.g., Wardâ€™s method) to determine cluster proximity.
