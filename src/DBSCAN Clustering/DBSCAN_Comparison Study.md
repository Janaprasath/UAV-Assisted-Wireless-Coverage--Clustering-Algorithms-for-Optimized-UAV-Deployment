DBSCAN CLUSTERING:
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) groups users based on spatial density, identifying core points (high-density regions), border points, and noise points

 GENERAL DBSCAN CLUSTERING ALGORITHM:
It operates in 3 steps:
1. Identify core points (points with â‰¥ min_samples neighbors within distance eps).
2. Expand clusters by connecting density-reachable core points.
3. Label outliers as noise.

Drawbacks of General DBSCAN for UAV Deployment
1. Uncontrolled cluster sizes: Density-based merging often creates oversized clusters (e.g.150 users), violating UAV capacity.
2. Noise neglect: Up to 15% of users are labeled as noise (unclustered), leaving them without coverage.
3. No centroid computation: Provides cluster labels but no UAV deployment coordinates.
4. Parameter sensitivity: Poor eps or min_samples choices lead to under/over-clustering.
